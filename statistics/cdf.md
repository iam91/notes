# Cumulative Distribution Function
## Percentile based statistics
- `median` 50th percentile
- `interquartile range(IQR)` difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles
## Random numbers
Regardless of the shape of the CDF, the distribution of percentile ranks is uniform.  
Generate random numbers with a given CDF:  
- Choose a percentile rank uniformly from the range 0â€“100.
- Find the value in the distribution that corresponds to the percentile rank you chose.
