# Basic Syntax
## Quotation in Python
single, double and triple quotes denote string literals
```python
word = 'word'
sentence = "This is a sentence."
paragraph = """This is a paragraph. It is
made up of multiple lines and sentences."""
```
gives:
- word = `word` 
- sentence = `This is a sentence.`
- paragraph = `This is a paragraph. It is\n made up of multiple lines and sentences.`
## Multiple Statements on a Single Line
```python
import sys; x = 'foo'; sys.stdout.write(x + '\n')
```
